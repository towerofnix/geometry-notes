[Altitude of a Triangle]
A line segment from a vertex to a point on the opposite side, or an extension
of the opposite side, that is perpendicular to that side.

Every triangle has 3 altitudes (one for each vertex).

An altitude is not necessarily inside its triangle - sometimes it is the side
itself, or is outside the triangle (e.g. in obtuse triangles).

[Orthocenter of a Triangle]
The point where all three altitudes of a triangle meet.
