[Volume of a Pyramid]
Equal to (1/3)(B)(h), where B is the pyramid's base area and h is the height of
the pyramid.
.
.  Note that this is not the same equation as that for cylinders and prisms,
.  V = Bh.
.
.  Note also that "h" refers to the actual height of the pyramid, from the base
.  to the tip, and not the slant height, a height of the pyramid's lateral
.  faces.
