A figure built from more than one regular shape.

left triangle....
x^2 + 4^2 = 5^2
x^2 + 16 = 25
x^2 = 9
x = 3

a = 1/2bh
a = 1/2(3)(4)
a = 1/2(12)
a = 6

rectangle.....
a = 8 * 4
a = 32

lower triangle....
x^2 + 3^2 = 5^2
x^2 + 9 = 25
x^2 = 16
x = 4

a = 1/2bh
a = 1/2(4)(3)
a = 1/2(12)
a = 6

figure.....
a = 6 + 32 + 6
a = 12 + 32
a = 44
