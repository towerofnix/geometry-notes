[Regular Polygon]
A polygon whose angles are all congruent.

[Apothem]
The line segment from the center of a regular polygon to the midpoint of any
side of the polygon.
.
Note that the apothem is NOT the line formed from the center of a regular
polygon to one of its vertexes. When given such a line, a right angle may be
formed and the pythagorean theorem may be used to evaluate the length of the
apothem.
