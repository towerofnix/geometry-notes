[Circle]
A set of all points in a plane equidistant from a given point in the plane,
which is the center of the circle.

[Radius]
Any line segment constructed between the center point of a circle and the
circle's circumference. All radii of a single circle are congruent.

[Equation of a Circle]
Circles are defined by the equation (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2, where the
center of the circle is defined by the coordinate (h, k) and r is the radius of
the circle.
