The rulers on the two computers used for this are different! On the original
computer used for all notes, it was 78 characters; on the desktop, 80
characters. Which should we go with? Either way, the whole thing will need some
updating.

Maybe rename '07 Area of Polygons and Circles' to '07 Area'?
Also there's a bunch of file names in that directory that I don't like, like
'Areas of Regular Polygons.geom', which should probably use singular 'Area'..

Standardize formula format and such. This documentation should be timeless,
which means we shouldn't be able to tell when a specific entry was written,
especially based on its formatting!

Standardize practice problem format. I've already got this mostly worked out in
my head, but there's still a couple of things that might need thought (like
when to capitalize section headings, and whether to use "value of x" or "x").

Publish the tmLanguage/YAML-tmLanguage into the repository! It's a handy
formatting document for compatible text editors (usually Sublime Text), with
support for jump-to-definition and such.
