!!Important - find the difference between intersect and intercept, and make
the right one is being used. I think it should usually be intersect.

The rulers on the two computers used for this are different! On the original
computer used for all notes, it was 78 characters; on the desktop, 80
characters. Which should we go with? Either way, the whole thing will need some
updating.
** Update: 80 characters for the separator width; don't let any characters
   appear past the 79th column. Example:

BAD:
Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blaaaah blah blaaah blah blah blah

GOOD:
Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blaaaah blah blaaah blah blah
blah

BAD:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

GOOD:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Maybe rename '07 Area of Polygons and Circles' to '07 Area'?
Also there's a bunch of file names in that directory that I don't like, like
'Areas of Regular Polygons.geom', which should probably use singular 'Area'..

Standardize formula format and such. This documentation should be timeless,
which means we shouldn't be able to tell when a specific entry was written,
especially based on its formatting!
- Update: the format used in Angles in Circles and other files around that time
  can probably be used. Next, to update the older documents..

Standardize practice problem format. I've already got this mostly worked out in
my head, but there's still a couple of things that might need thought (like
when to capitalize section headings, and whether to use "value of x" or "x").
